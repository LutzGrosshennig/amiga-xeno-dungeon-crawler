# amiga-xeno-dungeon-crawler (30th anniversary)

Do you know the game 'Xenomorph' (c) 1990 by Pandora? Back in 1990 some of my friends and me where enjoying playing the game on our Amigas whenever we could.

We thought: How cool would it be to be able to link two Amigas using the serial port and have a kind of very early CoOp (I dont think that this term even existed back then).

So we startet this project. I did the coding and the others supplied some graphics. These are early graphics so we could get started. 

I do remenber that we got the serial link working but I need to figure out the settings for WinUAE to link two instances of the emulator.

# Notes

Bear in mind that this code is 30 years old, I did not know better back then, I do now :-) and startet a new project called 'Xenomorph 2409' and you can find its devlog here:

You can watch a work in progress version of "Xenomorph 2409" on YouTube:

# amiga-xeno-dungeon-crawler (30th anniversary)

Do you know the game 'Xenomorph' (c) 1990 by Pandora or 'Dungeon Master', 'Eye of the Beholder'? Back in 1990 some of my friends and me where enjoying playing these games on our Amigas whenever we could.

We thought: How cool would it be to be able to link two Amigas using the serial port and have a kind of very early CoOp (I dont think that this term even existed at the time).

So we startet this project. I did the coding and the others supplied some graphics. These are early placeholder type graphics so we could get started. Unfortunatly we started studying in different city and our path slowy separated.

I do remenber that we got the serial link kind of working but I need to figure out the correct settings for WinUAE to link two instances of the emulator.

# Notes

Bear in mind that this code is 30 years old, I did not know better back then, I do now :-) and startet a new project called 'Xenomorph 2409' 

You can watch a work in progress version of "Xenomorph 2409" on YouTube:
